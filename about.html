<p> Lucy comes from a background in music and biological research, which all taught her to love the process of breaking down large problems into their constituents and telling a story with the results. While working in research, she realized that a career in data science allowed her to scratch that same itch without having to move to remote locations (where sometimes the forest critters would steal all of her socks!). She is based in NYC, and enjoys playing music with her friends, gardening, traveling, and riding Citi Bike. </p>
