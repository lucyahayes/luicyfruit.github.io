# What is My Music Taste?

## An analysis using the Spotify API

Whenever anyone asks me, "so what type of music do you listen to?", my usual answer is "... uh everything?". Having grown up with a very intense classical music training, my music taste ranges from Dvorak Symphonies, to early 2000's punk rock, to jazz ensembles. This project aims to quantify what type of music I listen to according to my Spotify playlists, to see if there are any features or combinations of features that make a song a "Lucy" song, and to build a predictor model on how likely I would be to like a song based on those features. I will be using the **Spotify API** to access my own user data, and to access public data.
